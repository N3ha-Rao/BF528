Use this notebook to quickly write the methods for the week:

`Signal Coverage Across Gene Bodies`
To visualize the genome-wide binding pattern of the transcription factor RUNX1, signal coverage across gene bodies 
was computed using the deepTools v3.5.1 (Ramírez et al., 2016) suite. First, the computeMatrix utility was employed 
to generate matrices containing the read counts from the bigWig files, considering a 2000 bp window upstream and 
downstream of the transcription start site (TSS) and transcription termination site (TTS), respectively. These matrices 
were generated for each ChIP sample, using the RefSeq gene annotations for the GRCh38 human reference genome as a reference.
The resulting matrices were then used as input for the plotProfile utility to generate visualizations of the average 
signal across gene bodies. These plots provide insights into the binding patterns of RUNX1, with enrichment in the 
promoter-TSS region suggesting a potential role in transcriptional regulation.

`Integration with RNAseq Results`
To investigate the relationship between RUNX1 binding and gene expression, the ChIP-seq results were integrated with 
previously published RNA-seq data (Barutcu et al., 2016; GEO accession GSE75070). The processed differential expression results 
(GSE75070_MCF7_shRUNX1_shNS_RNAseq_log2_foldchange.txt.gz) were downloaded, and the same filters and cutoffs as described in 
the original study were applied to identify significantly differentially expressed (DE) genes upon RUNX1 knockdown.
Using the annotated peak file and the list of DE genes, the proportion of DE genes with a RUNX1 peak within various distances 
from the TSS (±5 kb, ±20 kb, and ±100 kb) was calculated and visualized as stacked bar charts, replicating Figure 2f and 
Supplementary Figure S2D from the original publication.
