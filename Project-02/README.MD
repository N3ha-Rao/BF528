# Project 2: ChIP-Seq Analysis

This project involves analyzing ChIP-Seq data to identify significant peaks and associated genes. The analysis is structured into two main components:

1. **Peak Calling and Annotation**: Identifying significant peaks from ChIP-Seq data and annotating them to nearby genes.
2. **Differential Binding Analysis**: Comparing peak intensities between different conditions to identify differentially bound regions.
