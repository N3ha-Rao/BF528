# BF528 Project 1

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to analyze RNA-Seq data to understand gene expression patterns during cardiac regeneration in mammals. By employing high-throughput sequencing technologies, we aim to profile mRNA molecules comprehensively, facilitating insights into gene expression dynamics associated with cardiac repair mechanisms.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `docs/`: Documentation files, including `project_1_rnaseq.Rmd`, which outlines the project's methodology and objectives.
- `results/`: Directory for storing output files generated from analyses.
- `samples/`: Sample data files utilized in the project.
- `differential_expression.Rmd`: R Markdown file dedicated to differential expression analysis.
- `week1.Rmd`, `week2.Rmd`, `week3.Rmd`: R Markdown files corresponding to weekly assignments, detailing step-by-step analyses.
- `week1.snake`, `week2.snake`, `week3.snake`: Snakemake workflow files for each week's tasks, automating data processing pipelines.
